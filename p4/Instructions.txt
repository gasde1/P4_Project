How to access:

How to interact:
Use the slider to control the hammer speed, left slower right faster

There are 2 buttons for cameras, 1 for orbital view and the other for the car view

There are 2 different types of collisions, a normal collision that sends the car off into the void
and another that generates an explosions using a random particle effect

Use keyboard controls 'a' and 'd' to move left and right.  Use 'w' to speed up and 's' to slow down

I would have liked to add more with a curved ramp, but I spent all my time on P2
